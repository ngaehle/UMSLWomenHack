Each year a theme is provided to the participants and mentors to follow. Prior themes have included COVID-19 Concerns (2020), 
Women of Tech (2019), Women Empowerment (2018), Better the Community (2017), and Eliminate Diversity in the World (2016).

<!--In 2020, the theme was to find a solution for the current concerns of COVID-19 concerns. In 2019, the theme was for Women of Tech. In 2018, the theme was for women empowerment. In 2017, 
the theme was to better the community. In 2016, the theme was to eliminate the diversity in the world.--> 

<br> <br> The idea is to take the theme and come up with a creative idea that motivates the participants. In prior years, ideas ranged from social site for women empowerment
                                    to connecting people throughout diverse roles in the world.
